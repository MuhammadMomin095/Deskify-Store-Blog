        Sustainable Furniture: Why It Matters and How to Choose
        </h2>
      </div>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          As environmental concerns grow, sustainability in furniture design and manufacturing has become increasingly important. Hereâ€™s why sustainable furniture matters and how to make eco-friendly choices:
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Sustainable furniture is made from materials that are renewable, recyclable, and ethically sourced. By choosing such pieces, you are contributing to reducing environmental impact and supporting responsible production practices.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          When selecting sustainable furniture, consider pieces made from reclaimed wood, bamboo, or materials that use less energy to produce.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Additionally, choosing high-quality items that will last longer reduces the need for replacements, further minimizing waste.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Opt for furniture brands with certifications like FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) or those that prioritize reducing their carbon footprint.
        </p>
